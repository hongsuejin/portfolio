    <p class="title"><b>New Myth Generator</b> 2022-</p>
	
	<p class="information">So far it consists of 'Chapter 01' and 'Chapter 02'.<br><br>

    The video series ‘New myth generator’ establishes the hypothesis that ‘the nonlin- ear nature of myths allows modern people to endure in crisis and restore a dimen- sion of existence.’<br>
The first step toward resisting the irreversible violence of history and solving the crisis we face is to recognize the current situation.<br>
Perceiving the fantastic tyranny of the capital, based on the success stories dotted with free paradise and the proposition that history is irreversible, brings us a new beginning stage of ongoing resistance.<br>
What does the present purgatory, that we cannot perceive, look like and what im- ages can we present? In the confusion we are experiencing with our bodies, how will the mythical characteristic work as a key? What can we learn from it?<br>
Based on the analysis and research of similarities and differences in the way mythical non-historical and nonlinear characteristics worked on humans, and the way contemporary society exists and operates as a giant myth, this work raises questions about modern people’s historicism and seeks a way to dismantle colonial hegemony.<br><br>

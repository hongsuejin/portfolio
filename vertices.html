    <b>Vertices explores the disasters caused by the lack of translation between human beings, technology and nature. Using the sequences and images that are extracted through accessible digital archives or implemented through the 3d rendering process, these failures of inter-medial communication become exposed.<br><br>

In Mongolia, stones were considered an immortal database. The stone, which constantly passes through the wormhole and remembers archived historical moments, relates to the repetition of history and the non-linearity of this database. History and memory are more so defined by the medium it is inscribed upon, than the possibility of actuality. A body does not have meaning in itself, it awaits it through our interpretation. Databases and archives offer not knowledge or generational discourse, but practices of interpretation. Crossing the archival and implemented sequences, the video questions the possibility of successful networking.
